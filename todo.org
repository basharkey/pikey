#+TITLE: Todo

* Todo
- [X] Create oneshot layerbind (switches to layer and returns after 1 keypress of any key on that layer)
- [X] Test all bugs within code comments
- [ ] Error handling, only for functions that will actually encounter errors (i.e. grabbing keyboard input, parsing config)
- [ ] Create error when toggle layerbind in config doesn't have opposite defintion on other layer
- [-] Create rebinds, with seperate config section, layer support
  - [X] rebinding for switching keys to keys and mods to mods
  - [X] rebinding switching keys to mods and mods to keys (will require moving keys in and out of rebinds.Modifiers)
  - [ ] clean up the if statements into function for config parsing of rebinds
  - [ ] create toggle if rebinds affect keybinds/layerbinds (if key/layerbinds should use default keymap or rebinds keymap)
  - [X] seperate keymaps for keybind output and regular keyboard output (done just tidy up code) cleanup keys_to_bytes

* Bugs
- [-] higher keymap keys not working (eg. f13, playpause) this has to do with the USB device HID spec
  - [X] f13-f24
  - [ ] playpause, multimedia keys (may require another HID device)
    - [ ] implement device 2 (report id 2)
- [X] scroll lock presses "1"s after initial press
- [X] Holding down multi key keybind and then pressing the output key causes crash
- [X] When holding down mutli key keybind and then tapping another key it outputs both the keybind output key(s) and the key you tapped (this should only output the key you tapped)
- [ ] ctrl -> alt blocking ctrl, c -> meta, c
  - [ ] Rebinds need to be done seperately from keybinds
- [ ] Macos caps lock rebind causes lag??
- [X] Should output of keybinds affect other keybinds, no
- [X] meta-tab on Macos doesn't work the same when changing alt -> meta
  - [X] appears to only affect side agnostic modifiers (meta), doesn't seem to affect side specific mods (leftmeta)

* Features
- [X] Handling of multiple keyboards with different configs
- [X] Build pimk and Systmed service files and installation
- [ ] On the fly keybind creation
- [ ] Macro creation (long keybind output)
- [ ] On the fly macro recording
- [ ] Multiple keyboard support with different configs
- [ ] Holding down a key and switching layers doesn't change to outputted key - tmk does not have this - maybe implement in future
- [ ] Create automatic tests for errors/output key inconsistencies
- [ ] Potentially create seperate config for single key rebinds in keymap.go
- [ ] Auto mount USB drive to config location for config editing without networking

consumer devices don't show up under /dev/input/by-id
will have to develop new way to hook consumer devices and keyboards

hook consumer devices and capture input

send consumer device packets
