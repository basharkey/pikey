#+TITLE: Todo

* Todo
- [X] Test all bugs within code comments
- [ ] Error handling, only for functions that will actually encounter errors (i.e. grabbing keyboard input, parsing config)
- [ ] Create error when toggle layerbind in config doesn't have opposite defintion on other layer
- [ ] Create way to suppress keybinds from affecting other keybinds (see bug as well)

* Bugs
- [X] Holding down multi key keybind and then pressing the output key causes crash
- [ ] When holding down mutli key keybind and then tapping another key it outputs both the keybind output key(s) and the key you tapped (this should only output the key you tapped)
- [ ] When changing 2 keys to do the opposite you get an error (i.e alt -> meta, and meta -> alt)
  - [ ] Create seperate keymaps for each layer, and remap keys based on keybinds that only contains 1 input and 1 output key
- [ ] meta-tab on Macos doesn't work the same when changing alt -> meta
  - appears to only affect side agnostic modifiers (meta), doesn't seem to affect side specific mods (leftmeta)

* Features
- [X] Handling of multiple keyboards with different configs
- [X] Build pikey and Systmed service files and installation
- [ ] On the fly keybind creation
- [ ] Macro creation (long keybind output)
- [ ] On the fly macro recording
- [ ] Multiple keyboard support with different configs
- [ ] Holding down a key and switching layers doesn't change to outputted key - tmk does not have this - maybe implement in future
- [ ] Create automatic tests for errors/output key inconsistencies
- [ ] Potentially create seperate config for single key rebinds in keymap.go
- [ ] Auto mount USB drive to config location for config editing without networking
